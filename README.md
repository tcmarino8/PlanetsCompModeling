# PlanetsCompModeling
coursework from computational modeling under the earth and planetary department


In this course I learned how to use python to model matematical processes, from simple graphs to more complex heat transfer. We modeled natural processes such as erosion, diffusion, random processes, orbits, etc. Designing and implementing solvers for partial/ordinary differential equations using several numerical approaches including runge kutta and eulers.
